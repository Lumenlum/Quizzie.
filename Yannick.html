            <h3>Info/Lore:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>NEW FANTASY ACTION RPG.</strong><br>
                Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>• A Vast World Full of Excitement</strong><br>
                A vast world where open fields with a variety of situations and huge dungeons with complex and three-dimensional designs are seamlessly connected. As you explore, the joy of discovering unknown and overwhelming threats await you, leading to a high sense of accomplishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>• Lore:</strong><br>
                The Lands Between were ruled over by Queen Marika the Eternal, a being chosen by the Greater Will, who acted as a guardian and keeper of the Elden Ring and had numerous children. She also purposefully altered it and removed the Rune of Destined Death, making anybody under the Grace of the Elden Ring immortal. All people were affected in this way, but the Elden Ring and Erdtree seemed to reject some of them, marking them as Tarnished who were sent into exile. They still couldn't die, but they had been marked as unworthy in some way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marika had two husbands at different times during her rule: Godfrey, who became Tarnished himself and went into exile, then Radagon, the mysterious red-haired warrior. Both of these men became Elden Lords and gained much divine power through this union with Marika - in fact, while Marika is a supremely powerful being, her consorts, aka the Elden Lords, seem to be almost as powerful as she is.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the Elden Ring was later shattered into multiple Great Runes after an event called the Night of the Black Knives, where a clan of mysterious assassins killed several of Marika's demigod children. Among the surviving demigods, a terrible war broke out called the Shattering, caused when somebody attacked the Elden Ring and damaged it, altering reality further and compromising the Greater Will's vision of the world. Marika disappeared without warning and has not been seen since, with no clue or understanding by the wider world as to where she went.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end result of the war was a stalemate between numerous factions - many grand demigods have Great Runes scavenged from the damaged Elden Ring, but none have properly risen to power to either replace Marika (which certain powerful demigods known as Empyreans can do) or become the next consort, aka a new Elden Lord (which anybody could do). This pointless middle ground caused the Elden Ring’s blessing to partially fade from the Lands Between, and centuries later, the Tarnished are being called back by the Erdtree to try and break the stalemate. The Greater Will doesn't like this tepid state of affairs, and by failing to rise to power, all the existing demigods have kind of proven why they're not worthy of becoming Lords, or even new Empyrean vessels to replace Marika.
