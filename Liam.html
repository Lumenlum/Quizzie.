            <h3>Info/Lore:</h3>
            <p>     <strong>before the start of subnautica:</strong>
                Roughly a thousand years ago, an alien species called the Precursors were exploring various worlds when they contracted a bacterial disease called Kharaa which caused them to sicken and die. Desperate for a cure, the Precursors spread across the galaxy, researching different life forms in the hope of finding some basis for a cure or vaccine. Skip to a later time humanity has colonised space when a small ship called the Degasi flies too close to Planet 4546B and is promptly shot down by the automated Quarantine Enforcement Platform, still functional after all this time. Three of its crew of six die in the crash and the rest are stranded, one of their number being an important Mongolian CEO named Paul Torgal. The three survivors contract Kharaa and are killed in various horrible ways before they can call for help or make an escape, either getting attacked by ocean monsters or succumbing to the disease.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <strong>The events that lead to subnautica:</strong>
                You'll never guess what happens next. Ten years after that, a huge spaceship called the Aurora is flying through the same area, allegedly to build something called a Phasegate, but in reality it's secretly there to look for the remains of the Degasi. Again, the Quarantine Enforcement Platform shoots down the Aurora, and this is where we enter the story, playing a minor engineer named Ryley Robinson who survives in an escape pod and must try to find a way off-world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The start of subnautica</strong>
                Yes, it happens yet again - soon after the crash, a ship called the Sunbeam radios Ryley and promises to come in to help, only to be shot down by that damn Platform, killing all on board and making it clear to the player that if you ever want to leave, you have to shut down those guns first. At the same time, Ryley begins to discover the abandoned technology and buildings of the Precursors and receive telepathic messages from the trapped Emperor Leviathan. He also discovers that he's infected by the Kharaa, meaning that he can't leave without curing himself first, partly to stop spreading the infection, but also because the Quarantine Enforcement Platform won't allow access to anybody who's infected.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Midway trough subnautica</strong>
                Summoned telepathically, Ryley finds his way into the Primary Containment Facility and meets the Emperor Leviathan, now over two and a half thousand years old, who asks him to find the stolen eggs and bring them to her along with certain plants that will finally prompt them to hatch. In doing so, Ryley discovers the source of the infection, the history of the Precursors, and just what the hell that big laser is that keeps shooting things out of the air. Ryley goes to all four corners of the ocean to get the plants and find the eggs, bringing them back to the Emperor where they hatch at last, releasing a fresh supply of the enzyme that cures Ryley and begins to finally purge the ocean of Kharaa. The babies leave the facility, their mother playing with them briefly before starting to die of old age, and Ryley shuts down the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, allowing him to escape with a rocket he builds from schematics left on the wreckage of the Aurora. As he leaves, the Emperor telepathically wishes him farewell with the last of its strength, saying that in a sense, they are both leaving together.
